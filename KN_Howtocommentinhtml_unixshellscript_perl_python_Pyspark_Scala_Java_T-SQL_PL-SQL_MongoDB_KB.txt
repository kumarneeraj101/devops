##How to comment in html , unix shell script , perl, python, Pyspark, Scala, Java,  T-SQL, PL-SQL, MongoDB?

Certainly! Hereâ€™s how you can add comments in various programming languages:
1.	HTML:
o	HTML comments are not displayed in the browser but can help document your code.
o	Use the <!-- ... --> syntax to create comments.
o	Example:
o	<!-- This is a comment -->
o	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
2.	Unix Shell Script (Bash):
o	Use the # symbol to create single-line comments.
o	For multi-line comments, you can use a heredoc or surround the code with <<EOF ... EOF.
o	Example:
o	# This is a single-line comment
o	#!/bin/sh
o	# do valuable stuff here
o	touch /tmp/a
o	# now comment out all the stuff below up to the EOF
o	echo <<EOF
o	...
o	...
o	EOF
3.	Perl:
o	Use # for single-line comments.
o	For multi-line comments, you can use POD (Plain Old Documentation) with =begin comment ... =end comment.
o	Example:
o	# This is a single-line comment
o	=begin comment
o	This is a multi-line comment.
o	It can span multiple lines.
o	=end comment
4.	Python:
o	Use # for single-line comments.
o	Python does not have a direct syntax for multi-line comments, but you can use triple-quoted strings (docstrings) to create multiline comments.
o	Example:
o	# This is a single-line comment
o	"""
o	This is a multi-line comment.
o	It can span multiple lines.
o	"""
5.	Pyspark, Scala, and Java:
o	Use // for single-line comments.
o	For multi-line comments, use /* ... */.
o	Example (Java):
o	// This is a single-line comment
o	/*
o	 * This is a multi-line comment.
o	 * It can span multiple lines.
o	 */
6.	T-SQL and PL-SQL:
o	Use -- for single-line comments.
o	For multi-line comments, use /* ... */.
o	Example (T-SQL):
o	-- This is a single-line comment
o	/*
o	 This is a multi-line comment.
o	 It can span multiple lines.
o	*/
7.	MongoDB:
o	MongoDB does not have specific comment syntax within queries.
o	You can use // for single-line comments in the MongoDB shell.
o	Example:
o	// This is a single-line comment


8. How to comment out a code on VS code terraform

Attaching the Terraform documentation for commenting

The Terraform language supports three different syntaxes for comments:

# begins a single-line comment, ending at the end of the line.

// also begins a single-line comment, as an alternative to #.

/* and */ are start and end delimiters for a comment that might span over multiple lines.

The # single-line comment style is the default comment style and should be used in most cases. Automatic configuration formatting tools may automatically transform // comments into # comments, since the double-slash ...
